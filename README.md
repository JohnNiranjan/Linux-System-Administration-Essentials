<h2>Description</h2>
This Project provides essential Linux System Administration and security best practices in a virtualized environment. It demonstrates core sysadmin tasks such as managing users, setting up a secure file system, and controlling system services.

Key Features and Topics:

OS Installation and Configuration: Installation and basic setup of multiple Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Kali, Fedora) in a virtualized environment.



User and Group Management: Creation of user accounts and groups (IT, HR, Development, QA, Finance) to mirror an organizational structure, establishing password policies, and implementing sudo rules for administrative access.


File System Management: Designed and implemented a secure file system structure. This includes 

creating and mounting partitions to be persistent across reboots (using /etc/fstab) and assigning appropriate file and directory permissions (chmod/chown) to restrict sensitive data access to authorized personnel.


Service and Process Control: Demonstrated how to manage system services (like Bluetooth) using Vagrant to streamline operations, including disabling services at startup. Also covered 


process management tasks such as checking status, killing processes, and deprioritizing applications by changing the Niceness (NI) value.


Security Configuration: Focused on security hardening by enabling the firewall service to manage network traffic and configuring audit logging to maintain an exhaustive log of all system occurrences.of GenAI for this purpose.
